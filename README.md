- `Left` and `Right` or `Mouse` - Turn camera

- `CTRL` + `Space` - Toggle displaying of field of view on map

## Instructions

- Simply collect all the golden keys before reaching the exit.
- In many levels, after a specific amount of time has passed, a monster may spawn. Getting hit by the monster will give you an opportunity to spam `W` to attempt to escape. There is only a certain amount of time you have per level for this, however, and running out will result in you dying and having to restart the level.
- You can place flags on the ground to help you navigate, however if the monster comes into contact with one of these flags, it may destroy it.
- You have a compass which will point toward the monster's location, however you only have a limited amount of time to use it before you must wait for it to recharge.
- You can place a temporary barricade which will act like any other wall until it breaks. You may only have one built at a time, it cannot be broken early, and it will block you as well as the monster.
- Some levels contain single use key sensor which will display the location of every key on the map for a limited amount of time.
